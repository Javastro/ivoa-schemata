[![IVOA Schemata](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.javastro.ivoa/ivoa-schema.svg?label=ivoa-schema)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.javastro.ivoa/ivoa-schema/)

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/Javastro/ivoa-schemata/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Javastro/ivoa-schemata/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

The aim of this project is to gather together the  
[IVOA schemata](http://www.ivoa.net/xml/) so that they can be referred to as local
files - which in turn can have benefits to software that wants to use a schema
to validate an instance or generate other artifacts offline. 

The importance of local schema access is show by https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet

*Warning* - The schemata in the project should not be considered definitive if they differ
from those at the official source http://www.ivoa.net/xml/
